Method Overriding:

If subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class, it is known as method overriding in Java.

In other words, If a subclass provides the specific implementation of the method that has been declared by one of its parent class, it is known as method overriding.

Usage of Java Method Overriding:
Method overriding is used to provide the specific implementation of a method which is already provided by its superclass.
Method overriding is used for runtime polymorphism

Rules for Java Method Overriding:
The method must have the same name as in the parent class
The method must have the same parameter as in the parent class.
There must be an IS-A relationship (inheritance).


//class A
//{
//	public void show()
//	{
//		System.out.println("in A show");
//	}
//	public void config()
//	{
//		System.out.println("in A config");
//	}
//}
//class B extends A
//{
//	public void show()
//	{
//		System.out.println("in B show");

{
	public int add(int n1, int n2)
	{
		return n1+n2;
	}
}
class AdvCalc extends Calc
{
	public int add(int n1, int n2)
	{
		return n1+n2+1;
	}
}


public class Demo{
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
//		B obj=new B();
//		obj.show();
//		obj.config();
		
		AdvCalc obj=new AdvCalc();
		int r1=obj.add(3, 4);
		System.out.println(r1);
	}
